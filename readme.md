Create a REST POST API in Rust that receives a CSV file as a POST body. It then parses this CSV and returns the same data as an array of JSON objects. The API must be able to handle multiple clients concurrently. Document the API. How would you test this?
Stretch goal - Store the data in a Postgres table so that it can be recalled via another API
Stretch goal - Create a SPA/page/component a user can use to upload a csv file to this API and get back the JSON
